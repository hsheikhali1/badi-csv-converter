## Basic converter for CSV to JSON

### Requirements

- Python 3.9

### Getting Started

This was built using python 3.9 so make sure that you have the latest version.

### Running the converter

This is meant to be run in the commandline so the steps are:

1. Make sure the csv you want to convert is in the same directory as the python script.
2. Run the script by doing: `python3 main.py`
3. After running it, you should have a converted json file in the directory
